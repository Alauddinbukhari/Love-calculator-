# Love Calculator

The Love Calculator is a simple Python program that calculates a love score between two people based on the number of occurrences of certain letters in their names. The program asks the user to input the two names, concatenates them, converts the resulting string to lowercase, and then counts the number of occurrences of each letter in the string. The counts are then added up for the letters in the word 'true' and in the word 'love', and these scores are combined to give the final love score.

## How to Use
1.Clone the repository to your local machine.

3.Run the program by entering python love_calculator.py.
4.When prompted, enter the two names for which you want to calculate the love score.
5.The program will calculate the love score and display it on the screen.
